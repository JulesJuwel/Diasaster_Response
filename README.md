# Diasaster_Response

Is there a way with Machine Learning to decide how to react best to an emergency by going through the textmessage coming in from social media, directly or from the news.

## Motivation

Sometimes, especially during natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires,... the emergency control center has to go through a lot of information from media, direct calls etc. to decide how to react best (firedepartment, police,....). So maybe there is a quicker way to find out which kind of help is needed? Thats what I try to find out here.

## Installation

For running the code you need numpy, pandas, nltk (nltk.download(['punkt', 'wordnet'])), sqlalchemy (create_engine), re, pickle and sklearn. 
Python 3.6 was used for the attached files. If you use anything esle you might need to make some changes to the files.
