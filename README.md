Is there a way with Machine Learning to decide who to sent best to an emergency by going to the textmessage coming in from social media, directly or from the news.

## Motivation

Sometimes, especially during natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires,... the emergency control center has to go through a lot of information from media, direct calls etc. to decide who to sent out (firedepartment, police,....). So maybe there is a quicker way to find out which kind of help is needed? Thats what I try to find out here.

## Installation

For running the code you only need numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn. 
Python 3.* was used for the attached files. If you use anything esle you might need to make some changes to the notebook.
